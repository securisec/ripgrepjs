	/**
	 *When this flag is used, ripgrep will dynamically choose between
           supported regex engines depending on the features used in a
           pattern. When ripgrep chooses a regex engine, it applies that
           choice for every regex provided to ripgrep (e.g., via multiple
           -e/--regexp or -f/--file flags).

           As an example of how this flag might behave, ripgrep will attempt
           to use its default finite automata based regex engine whenever the
           pattern can be successfully compiled with that regex engine. If
           PCRE2 is enabled and if the pattern given could not be compiled
           with the default regex engine, then PCRE2 will be automatically
           used for searching. If PCRE2 isn't available, then this flag has no
           effect because there is only one regex engine to choose from.

           In the future, ripgrep may adjust its heuristics for how it decides
           which regex engine to use. In general, the heuristics will be
           limited to a static analysis of the patterns, and not to any
           specific runtime behavior observed while searching files.

           The primary downside of using this flag is that it may not always
           be obvious which regex engine ripgrep uses, and thus, the match
           semantics or performance profile of ripgrep may subtly and
           unexpectedly change. However, in many cases, all regex engines will
           agree on what constitutes a match and it can be nice to
           transparently support more advanced regex features like look-around
           and backreferences without explicitly needing to enable them.

	/**
	 *Enabling this flag will cause ripgrep to search binary files. By
           default, ripgrep attempts to automatically skip binary files in
           order to improve the relevance of results and make the search
           faster.

           Binary files are heuristically detected based on whether they
           contain a NUL byte or not. By default (without this flag set), once
           a NUL byte is seen, ripgrep will stop searching the file. Usually,
           NUL bytes occur in the beginning of most binary files. If a NUL
           byte occurs after a match, then ripgrep will still stop searching
           the rest of the file, but a warning will be printed.

           In contrast, when this flag is provided, ripgrep will continue
           searching a file even if a NUL byte is found. In particular, if a
           NUL byte is found then ripgrep will continue searching until either
           a match is found or the end of the file is reached, whichever comes
           sooner. If a match is found, then ripgrep will stop and print a
           warning saying that the search stopped prematurely.

           If you want ripgrep to search a file without any special NUL byte
           handling at all (and potentially print binary data to stdout), then
           you should use the -a/--text flag.

           The --binary flag is a flag for controlling ripgrep's automatic
           filtering mechanism. As such, it does not need to be used when
           searching a file explicitly or when searching stdin. That is, it is
           only applicable when recursively searching a directory.

           Note that when the -u/--unrestricted flag is provided for a third
           time, then this flag is automatically enabled.

           This flag can be disabled with --no-binary. It overrides the
           -a/--text flag.

	/**
	 *When enabled, ripgrep will use block buffering. That is, whenever a
           matching line is found, it will be written to an in-memory buffer
           and will not be written to stdout until the buffer reaches a
           certain size. This is the default when ripgrep's stdout is
           redirected to a pipeline or a file. When ripgrep's stdout is
           connected to a terminal, line buffering will be used. Forcing block
           buffering can be useful when dumping a large amount of contents to
           a terminal.

           Forceful block buffering can be disabled with --no-block-buffered.
           Note that using --no-block-buffered causes ripgrep to revert to its
           default behavior of automatically detecting the buffering strategy.

           colors, but if it is redirected to a file or a pipe, then it will
           suppress color output. ripgrep will suppress color output in some
           other circumstances as well. For example, if the TERM environment

	/**
	 *This flag specifies color settings for use in the output. This flag
           may be provided multiple times. Settings are applied iteratively.
           Colors are limited to one of eight choices: red, blue, green, cyan,
           magenta, yellow, white and black. Styles are limited to nobold,
           bold, nointense, intense, nounderline or underline.

           The format of the flag is {type}:{attribute}:{value}.  {type}
           should be one of path, line, column or match.  {attribute} can be
           fg, bg or style.  {value} is either a color (for fg and bg) or a
           text style. A special format, {type}:none, will clear all color
           settings for {type}.

           For example, the following command will change the match color to
           magenta and the background color for line numbers to yellow:

               rg --colors 'match:fg:magenta' --colors 'line:bg:yellow' foo.

           Extended colors can be used for {value} when the terminal supports
           ANSI color sequences. These are specified as either x (256-color)
           or x,x,x (24-bit truecolor) where x is a number between 0 and 255
           inclusive. x may be given as a normal decimal number or a
           hexadecimal number, which is prefixed by 0x.

           For example, the following command will change the match background
           color to that represented by the rgb value (0,128,255):

               rg --colors 'match:bg:0,128,255'

           or, equivalently,

           different message types:

           begin - A message that indicates a file is being searched and
           contains at least one match.

           end - A message the indicates a file is done being searched. This
           message also include summary statistics about the search for a
           particular file.

           match - A message that indicates a match was found. This includes
           the text and offsets of the match.

           context - A message that indicates a contextual line was found.
           This includes the text of the line, along with any match
           information if the search was inverted.

           summary - The final message emitted by ripgrep that contains
           summary statistics about the search across all files.

           Since file paths or the contents of files are not guaranteed to be
           valid UTF-8 and JSON itself must be representable by a Unicode
           encoding, ripgrep will emit all data elements as objects with one
           of two keys: text or bytes.  text is a normal JSON string when the

	/**
	 *Enable matching across multiple lines.

           When multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep will lift the restriction
           that a match cannot include a line terminator. For example, when
           multiline mode is not enabled (the default), then the regex \p{any}
           will match any Unicode codepoint other than \n. Similarly, the
           regex \n is explicitly forbidden, and if you try to use it, ripgrep
           will return an error. However, when multiline mode is enabled,
           \p{any} will match any Unicode codepoint, including \n, and regexes
           like \n are permitted.

           An important caveat is that multiline mode does not change the
           match semantics of .. Namely, in most regex matchers, a .  will by
           default match any character other than \n, and this is true in
           ripgrep as well. In order to make .  match \n, you must enable the
           "dot all" flag inside the regex. For example, both (?s).  and
           (?s:.)  have the same semantics, where .  will match any character,
           including \n. Alternatively, the --multiline-dotall flag may be
           passed to make the "dot all" behavior the default. This flag only
           applies when multiline search is enabled.

           There is no limit on the number of the lines that a single match
           can span.

           WARNING: Because of how the underlying regex engine works,
           multiline searches may be slower than normal line-oriented
           searches, and they may also use more memory. In particular, when
           multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep requires that each file it
           searches is laid out contiguously in memory (either by reading it
           onto the heap or by memory-mapping it). Things that cannot be
           memory-mapped (such as stdin) will be consumed until EOF before
           searching can begin. In general, ripgrep will only do these things
           when necessary. Specifically, if the --multiline flag is provided
           but the regex does not contain patterns that would match \n
           characters, then ripgrep will automatically avoid reading each file
           into memory before searching it. Nevertheless, if you only care
           about matches spanning at most one line, then it is always better
           to disable multiline mode.

           --multiline flag.

           Normally, a .  will match any character except newlines. While this

           mode, which is otherwise enabled by default. If PCRE2 matching is
           not enabled, then this flag has no effect.

           When PCRE2's Unicode mode is enabled, several different types of
           patterns become Unicode aware. This includes \b, \B, \w, \W, \d,
           \D, \s and \S. Similarly, the .  meta character will match any
           Unicode codepoint instead of any byte. Caseless matching will also
           use Unicode simple case folding instead of ASCII-only case
           insensitivity.

           Unicode mode in PCRE2 represents a critical trade off in the user
           experience of ripgrep. In particular, unlike the default regex
           engine, PCRE2 does not support the ability to search possibly
           invalid UTF-8 with Unicode features enabled. Instead, PCRE2
           requires that everything it searches when Unicode mode is enabled
           is valid UTF-8. (Or valid UTF-16/UTF-32, but for the purposes of
           ripgrep, we only discuss UTF-8.) This means that if you have
           PCRE2's Unicode mode enabled and you attempt to search invalid
           UTF-8, then the search for that file will halt and print an error.
           For this reason, when PCRE2's Unicode mode is enabled, ripgrep will
           automatically "fix" invalid UTF-8 sequences by replacing them with
           the Unicode replacement codepoint.

           If you would rather see the encoding errors surfaced by PCRE2 when
           Unicode mode is enabled, then pass the --no-encoding flag to
           disable all transcoding.

               WARNING: When this flag is set, ripgrep will unconditionally spawn a

           When searching over sets of files that may require one of several

           the --pre flag. Any non-matching files will be searched without
           using the preprocessor command.

           This flag is useful when searching many files with the --pre flag.
           Namely, it permits the ability to avoid process overhead for files
           that don't need preprocessing. For example, given the following

               #!/bin/sh

           files with a .pdf extension.

           Multiple --pre-glob flags may be used. Globbing rules match
